# Changelog

User-visible behavior, compatibility, important fixes and repository changes. The first public release is `0.0.1`, distributed through GitHub Releases.

## 0.0.8 — 2026-09-30

- Group Activity by track with current work, assignment and decision waits, recent verification results, and bounded task details. Preserve full instructions, evidence links and selection across Korean/English switching and reloads; mark stale or disconnected observations as needing confirmation.
- Merge clearly identical pending assess/work obligations only for the same track, candidate, document revision, task kind and exact purpose. Preserve each parent request atomically, including interrupted writes and cache reconstruction; completed tasks are not reused as new fulfillment evidence.
- Support bounded `replace-v1` text proposals with exact base/file checks and durable application recovery, while preserving unrelated edits and legacy whole-file proposals.
- Retain original verification stdout/stderr as separate artifacts with bounded reads and explicit missing, partial and completed states. Keep log evidence available through recovery and dashboard detail views.
- Keep state/configuration formats and worker/skill protocols unchanged.

## 0.0.7 — 2026-09-28

- Remove the default 600-second worker deadline across native and compatibility workers and their supervisors. Explicit project limits remain supported; JSON `null` selects unlimited execution.
- Register native worker activity in the owning Orca worktree's sidebar through a host-side status bridge. Verify the actual pane projection and retain its receipt without enabling model hooks or treating UI state as completion evidence.
- Check native worker claims while waiting, retire unchanged viewers after confirmed cancellation cleanup, and expose concrete native failure diagnostics.
- Avoid filesystem and Git checks for each streamed output fragment; fence complete native proposals before adoption. Periodically reconcile full history on the same connection so a missing completion notification cannot leave a finished worker waiting indefinitely. Preserve partial WebSocket frames across idle polls.
- Cancel active native, headless and verification work through owned process supervision, preserving cancellation evidence across recovery.
- Reclaim unchanged verifier-generated artifacts and remove confirmed landed, owned Git/Orca worktrees. Consume native viewer retirement and attributed supervisor exit evidence, while preserving uncertain or reused resources.
- Keep agent work within the user-requested scope, report additional work separately, reuse sufficient verification evidence and retain automatic cleanup unless the user explicitly requests resource preservation.

## 0.0.6 — 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- Remove the exact Codex CLI version gate and credential-file restrictions from native worker selection. Reuse the existing Codex login without copying credentials, while retaining read-only execution and disabling inherited MCP tools for the worker.
- Remove terminal-count limits, capacity ledgers and project-wide historical terminal admission checks. Old launch records and ledger files no longer block new workers and remain preserved as historical evidence.
- Preserve completed native proposals when terminal viewer cleanup is deferred. Keep process termination, exact session/HEAD checks and protection of user-owned terminals.

### Changed

- Remove the unused intermediate headless supervisor and tests for retired capacity restrictions. Continue cleaning each owned terminal after its worker exits.
- Run one Linux/Python 3.11 job for normal code changes. Version-only releases run lint, package build and clean installation checks without repeating the runtime suite; dependency and updater changes retain relevant checks. The four-environment Linux/macOS × Python matrix remains available through manual dispatch.
- Keep state/configuration formats and worker/skill protocols unchanged. Old terminal concurrency/idle settings no longer impose an additional admission limit; `--jobs` still controls driver task concurrency.

## 0.0.5 — 2026-09-27

### Added

- Declare verification inputs with `init --verify-identity`: track selected files, environment digests and a nonce alongside exact-candidate evidence. Changed or unavailable inputs invalidate cached success; legacy evidence requires fresh verification.
- Support native Orca-managed Codex worker sessions for the verified Codex CLI 0.157.1 protocol, with owned workspaces, isolated App Server sessions, exact thread/turn associations and fresh review provenance. Launch status and the dashboard expose the recorded mode and compatibility reason.
- Add bounded worker-terminal capacity, durable retirement evidence and synthetic terminal/native-session measurement scripts.

### Fixed

- Preserve process ownership and cleanup evidence across worker/verification exit, interruption and recovery. Unknown process or terminal cleanup blocks replacement instead of allowing uncertain duplicate launches.
- Retire owned idle Orca/tmux worker terminals with checked identity and activity, retain uncertain resources for inspection, and account for existing terminals before dispatch.

### Changed

- Ground planning, work, review and starter-template acceptance conditions in the selected outcome and affected invariants; preserve user tradeoffs and keep optional improvements outside required scope.
- Document verification-input limits, native-session compatibility and this repository's initial self-hosting setup. State/configuration formats and worker/skill protocols remain unchanged.

### Validation

- Published `0.0.4` to `0.0.5` engine upgrade, skill update/rollback and engine rollback passed in an isolated installation; canonical state, pending work and language bindings remained unchanged.
- Synthetic future-version update checks passed, including active-dashboard exclusion, failed-update rollback and recovery with the CLI missing. Synthetic wheels are test fixtures only.
- Native-session coverage uses local synthetic server/CLI/process fixtures; real-model/external live acceptance for the new native route has not been performed.

## 0.0.4 — 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Commit only proposed paths during ordinary work, preserving unrelated staged/unstaged changes and refusing to overwrite existing edits on proposed paths. Integration repairs validate a durable checkout/index checkpoint and record the adopted merge tree before committing.
- Check clean checkout and exact HEAD before verification cache reuse, before/after review, and at review recording, publication and landing gates. Verification that changes HEAD cannot be recorded as successful; an identical tree at a new HEAD needs current evidence.
- Run verification commands in a separate process group. On timeout, terminate and confirm the group, including children surviving their parent or ignoring termination; successful parents cannot leave background writers. Unconfirmed cleanup requires attention instead of scheduling more work.

### Validation

- 123 Python tests passed locally, including 11 execution-boundary tests and 11 integration-repair tests. The boundaries were reproduced against `0.0.3` using local Git repositories and real subprocesses without model calls or remote publication.

- Published `0.0.3` to `0.0.4` engine upgrade, skill manifest update/rollback and engine rollback passed in an isolated installation; canonical state, pending work and language bindings remained unchanged.

## 0.0.3 — 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Connect failed integration to the repair checkout: fetch and pin the current base, merge it into the candidate branch, and provide conflict markers plus readable ancestor/candidate/base files through evidence paths. Resume interrupted repairs without discarding the merge, including after a decision answer or a commit before state persistence.
- Require renewed verification, publication and independent review of the repaired candidate before landing. Preserve both merge parents even when resolution keeps the candidate tree. Distinguish Git execution errors from actual unresolved conflicts, and repair combined-verification failures on the merged tree.

### Validation

- 111 Python tests passed for the repair implementation, including 10 local Git conflict/recovery regressions. Repair tests use deterministic workers reading real checkout and evidence files; no new live-model acceptance is claimed.
- Published `0.0.2` to `0.0.3` engine upgrade, skill manifest update/rollback and engine rollback passed in an isolated installation; canonical state and language bindings remained unchanged.

## 0.0.2 — 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Complete the resource lifecycle after delivery: clean owned implementation/integration/triage worktrees and confirmed idle worker terminals, retain evidence and branches, and journal deferred or interrupted cleanup for retry without reopening the track.
- Commit task completion and track completion atomically so reconciliation cannot reopen finished work in between. Preserve the candidate SHA separately from the triage checkout SHA.

### Validation

- Upgraded an isolated installation from the published `0.0.1` wheel to `0.0.2`, updated and rolled back project skills, then rolled back the engine. Canonical state and project language bindings remained unchanged.
- Real Codex workers in 14 Orca terminals completed three parallel tracks through independent reviews, GitHub PR merges, triage and issue closure in a fresh public fixture, without decisions or runtime errors. Follow-up documentation was registered/linked and left unselected. See the [run artifacts](https://github.com/JakeB-5/todo-flow-terminal-e2e-20260924).

### Changed

- Path-based worker protocol 2: run in the assigned checkout with read-only search/read tools; pass document, diff and evidence paths instead of source snapshots. Remove the aggregate 150 KB source cap and diff truncation. Legacy custom adapters must adopt protocol 2 explicitly.
- Prefer visible Orca terminals, configured terminal launchers or an existing tmux session; use headless when unavailable or explicitly selected. Preserve streamed logs, terminal handles, worker PIDs and completion receipts, and stop uncertain launches without spawning duplicates.
- Skip the CI matrix for root Markdown guides and presentation assets alone. Check `main` pushes and pull requests, avoid duplicate tag/feature-branch push runs, cancel superseded runs and allow manual full checks.

## 0.0.1 — 2026-09-24

### Added

- English and Korean workflow-cycle diagrams covering todo, trackpicks, trackrun, watchlist and follow-up selection.
- Installed version reporting for both CLI entrypoints, explicit release compatibility contracts and rejection of unknown state/config/worker/skill formats.
- Guarded uv-tool engine upgrades from a supplied newer wheel, environment/entrypoint backups, rollback, and an independent runner for recovery when an update interrupts the CLI.
- Per-project skill installation manifests, dry-run updates, user-edit/conflict handling, legacy baseline adoption, retired-resource handling and recoverable rollback.
- Cooperative runtime/update locks, known-project compatibility preflight, and blocking for unresolved running work or recorded live workers.
- Update operations guide, a prioritized future release checklist and isolated real uv-tool update/rollback/failure acceptance tests.

- English-first README with a Korean companion, product demonstration, first-run walkthrough, support matrix and FAQ.
- Dedicated agent installation, operations and demo guides that work without ignored local design notes.
- MIT license and package license metadata.
- Project language choice during initialization and standalone skill installation: English or Korean. Interactive CLI prompts; unattended CLI defaults to English; installation agents ask when no preference is available.
- English/Korean dashboard messages, accessible labels, localized dates/counts and a project-specific browser display preference.
- Project language in installed skill context, built-in worker instructions, custom-adapter input and generated follow-up documents.
- Optional, nonblocking Jev recommendations for todo investigation/overlap screening and watchlist changed-source review.
- Public-safe HTML track examples and reproducible dashboard captures.
- CI configuration for local tests, Python lint/format, dashboard localization and package builds on Linux and macOS.
- `todo-flow` CLI and `trackrun` entrypoint for selected durable work requests.
- Project-installed todo, track-picks, work, review, landing, triage and Watch skills.
- HTML/Markdown/JSON registration with preserved SVG, images, JavaScript assets and document revisions.
- Searchable file authority, rebuildable query cache and migration from legacy SQL state.
- Parallel tracks in separate worktrees; ownership, durable handoffs, questions, pause/resume/cancel and recovery.
- Independent Claude/Codex workers and exact-candidate review.
- GitHub issues, PRs and reviews; verified integration commits, effect receipts and reconciliation.
- Post-landing triage for original-scope repairs, existing/new TODOs, conditional watches and evidence-based closure.
- Continuous active TODO lists, separate completed search, activity and evidence views.
- Local tests, disposable public acceptance scripts and synthetic large-list fixtures.
- A 33× daily commit activity visual with collapsible measurement notes and anonymous January–September aggregates.

### Changed

- Prepare package metadata and public version references for the first `0.0.1` release.

- Public skill instructions and starter templates now use English. New user-facing content follows the selected project language; existing documents are preserved.
- README prioritizes product outcomes, actual UI, quick start and an agent installation prompt; detailed operation has moved to shared root guides.
- Tracks and runtime records use files as authority; SQLite is disposable.
- Follow-up registration remains separate from selection; completion and issue closure require current cleared triage.
- `docs/` remains local-only and excluded from Git and distributions. Shared usage and contribution guidance does not depend on it.
- Public documents, examples and metric assets omit identifying source-project metadata.

### Fixed

- Install ripgrep explicitly in CI instead of relying on runner images; use current action releases and a validated uv version.

- Triage duplicate search no longer mistakes historical `revisions/` documents for current track IDs.
- Post-landing repair reopens the issue and distinguishes closure receipts for the new delivery cycle.

### Validation of update support

- 81 Python tests and six dashboard localization tests passed; the update cases include conflicts, exact rollback, interrupted recovery, retired skills, protected context, unsupported formats and maintenance exclusion.
- Isolated real uv tool acceptance exercised `0.0.1` to a synthetic `0.0.2`, active-dashboard blocking, skill update/rollback, engine rollback and automatic rollback of a deliberately broken synthetic `0.0.3`.
- The external recovery runner restored an interrupted installation after its CLI disappeared, without the original update environment variables.
- Every canonical project state file remained byte-for-byte unchanged, and queued work remained queued. No models or remote effects were used by this update acceptance test.
- Release build, Python lint/format, JavaScript checks and package contents verified locally. The hosted CI update matrix is configured but has not been run here.

### Validation of language and documentation changes

- 65 Python tests and six dashboard localization tests passed, including language persistence, project isolation, adapter input, document preservation and focused decision drafts.
- Both languages checked in the real browser at desktop and narrow widths. Selection, unsent answers, expanded details, archive search and reload preferences were preserved.
- Interactive terminal language selection, isolated wheel installation, bundled templates/translations and source distribution contents verified.
- Python lint/format, JavaScript syntax and all nine skill metadata checks passed. Hosted CI is configured but has not been run as part of this change.

### Prior validation

- 2026-09-24: the prior runtime suite passed 57 tests.
- A real terminal exercise covered agent-authored HTML TODOs, selection, parallel implementation, review, landing, triage and issue closure. Two initial tracks recovered in new sessions after the duplicate-search fix; a fresh track then completed without further intervention.
- That disposable public fixture had three merged PRs, three closed issues and 13 passing tests on the final remote main. This does not establish large-codebase, Forgejo or multi-repository support.
