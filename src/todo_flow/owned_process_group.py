"""Pin a dedicated group's PID until its last live member exits.

Only this object may reap its direct child. Do not install a SIGCHLD reaper,
call waitpid(-1), or pass its private Popen to other code. This is a live-driver
ownership primitive, not permission to reconstruct ownership from stored PIDs.
Callers must journal intent before spawn. Failed cleanup retains the live object
in this driver's pending registry until a successful retry. Driver-death recovery
still needs a separately surviving supervisor.

leader_exited() observes zombies without reaping them. The unreaped session
leader pins the PID/PGID even after its command exits. No group lookup or signal
is permitted once that pin has been released.
